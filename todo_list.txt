Things we need to do: 

- Graph data structure [DONE]
- Graph generator
- isValidColouring method that checks if graph is a valid colouring [DONE]
- Graph parser; takes a file representation of a graph and constructs a "Graph" [DONE]
- colorGraph; method that colors the graph [DONE]

- Modify single-threaded solution to take graph file as parameter + output True/False

Current solution: 
- Colors graph by backtracking

Parallelized solution:
